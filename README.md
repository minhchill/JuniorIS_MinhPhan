# CAPTURING THE FEELING: A WEB-BASED PHYSICS SIMULATION

Overview

This project presents an interdisciplinary exploration of computer science, mathematics,
physics, and visual arts through an attempt to explore simulating two subjects of interest -
a piece of cloth and bread. The final software is created using the JavaScript language on
an HTML canvas and supplemental libraries as needed. One example is p5.js - a JavaScript
library designed for artists, designers, and educators to create interactive digital art and
visualizations. The overarching research goal is to investigate some current applications of
combining science and art to visualize knowledge and enhance web-based human-computer
interaction.
Keywords: physics simulation, cloth, texturing, web design


Purpose

In the creation of this model, my key objectives are: (1) to create a working simulation
for the purpose of this independent study assignment, (2) to explore the mathematics and
arts of physical-based simulation, (3) to utilize web design principles in my final deliverable
to create an interactive program that is user-friendly.

Instruction

The project can run on virtually all computer machines that can host HTML canvases.
Please start exploring from the mainmenu.html since it will link to all the programs created during my research process
